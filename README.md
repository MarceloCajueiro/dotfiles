# Dotfiles

Hey guys!

Here is my dotfiles.

They are inspired in several another ones from [Gabriel Sobrinho](https://github.com/sobrinho/),
[Ben Orenstein](https://github.com/r00k/) and [Gary Bernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt).


## Instalattion

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MarceloCajueiro/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ rake install
```

Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```

Run `:BundleInstall` in vim.
