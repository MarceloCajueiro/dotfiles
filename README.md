# Dotfiles

Hey guys!

Here is my dotfiles for Mac OS X.

In the past I used the dotfiles from my friend [@Sobrinho](https://github.com/sobrinho/) but my necessities were changed then I do my own dotfiles based on the [@Sobrinho](https://github.com/sobrinho/)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/sobrinho/dotfiles).

## Usage

Clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/marcelocajueiro/dotfiles.git`

And run the install:

`$ cd dotfiles`

`$ sh install`

## These dotfiles add some configurations or aliases to:

* Ack
* Git
* Ruby
* Ruby gems
* RVM
* Zsh
